# Self Driving Car DQN

This is an implementation of Stanford's CS239 final project paper by Matt Vitelli and Aran Nayebi.

Instead of using VDrift as in the paper, we decide to create our own simulation in Unity.

In this project, we train a CNN, a RNN and a hybrid model of the two to see how they would perform in this simulated environment.
